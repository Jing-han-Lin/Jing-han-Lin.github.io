Welcome to my homepage!

My name is Jinghan Lin, pronounced as [ʨiᵊŋ⁵¹ xan³⁵ lin³⁵]. 

I am currently pursuing my Master's degree in _Chinese Linguistics_ at Peking University under the supervision of Prof. Yunjia Wang. 

My research interests are phonetics and phonology, especially acoustic and perceptual research on sound variation and change, cue weighting in sound contrast. As a native speaker, I also have a strong interest in Southern Min Chinese dialects.

In my spare time, I enjoy piano, jogging and badminton.

Please contact me at **jinghanlin11** [at] **outlook** [dot]** com**.
